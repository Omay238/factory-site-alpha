    <small>This is a very quick site for description.</small>
    <p>Factory Site Alpha is an attempt at a 2D factory builder game. None of the 2D factory games I've played in the past have been particularly fun, because it feels like there's so much in the way of making a factory. This game is aiming to be a factory that is easy to make the way you make it.</p>
